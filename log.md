## Week 1 (March 28 - April 3)

* **Goal:** Finish preprocessing on image dataset - accomplished
* **Tasks:**
  * Alexander - Uploaded CS225 image library to the repo. Made a .gitignore file for the repo.
  * Khoa - Wrote a Python script to download CIFAR-10 from https://github.com/knjcode/cifar2png and to select 10 images from each category randomly to reduce the size of the dataset. Saved the dataset in the data folder.
  * Brandon - Wrote a C++ script which used the CS225 image library to grayscale every image from the data folder and save them in a grayscale_data folder. Wrote a Makefile.
* **Problems:** None
* **Next week:** Since we successfully accomplished this week's goal without any issues, we will continue following our initial plan in the team proposal - this means we will begin transforming the images into graphs.
