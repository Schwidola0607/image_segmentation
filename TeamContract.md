# Communication
* Team Meetings: We will meet every Tuesday from 7-8 to discuss any new changes that we need to make on the project. Most of the work will be done asynchronously with all communication done through our private Discord group chat. We commit to responding to Discord messages within 24 hours.
* Meeting Notes/General Communication: During our meetings, any member can write down any new changes that need to be done, and after our meeting, we can compile the notes nicely under one single message with a specific title so we can easily search for it later. In addition, we will also pin anything important (ie. documents, research papers, and meeting notes).
* Respect: As expected, each team member will have the chance to share their ideas without being interrupted. Any significant changes or plans will also need to be approved by the other team members

# Collaboration
* Github (CD/CI development): Allows for constantly updated code and backups in case we have an issue that we cannot revert. This also allows other team members to see what others have done in order to reduce conflicts and ensure accountability.
* General Collaboration: Post messages on Discord to communicate if any changes are being made and what changes they are. This is to prevent people from doing the same tasks and to ensure that everyone agrees with any changes that will be made to reduce any wasted time.
* Time Commitment: Each member is expected to contribute no less than 2 hours of work with no limit on the amount of work that can be done (however don’t finish the whole project). The amount of hours done will be verified under the honor system, but considering the project, there is a lot to be done. 
* Task Distribution: During the team meetings, each member will need to explain what they did and what needs to be done. After this, we can discuss how to evenly distribute the tasks that must be completed before our next meeting.
* Assistance: The group chat also exists as a place to ask for help or guidance if needed.
Conflict Resolution: Even though it is highly unlikely that a conflict will arise due to distributing tasks during team meetings and frequently updating code on Github, we would simply assign an extra task for each conflict so that the work done would remain evenly distributed.
